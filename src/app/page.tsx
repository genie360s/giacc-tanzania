            GIACC-Tanzania is an independent not-for-profit organisation based
            in Dar es salaam, Tanzania. It is an Affiliate of
            GIACC-International. GIACC-Tanzania believes that corruption can
            only be prevented and dealt with if both public and private sector
            organisations implement effective anti-corruption measures as a
            necessary and core part of their day-to-day corporate, procurement
            and project management.
            <br />
            It was founded in 2023 by Eng. Laurent Ndalichako, Eng. Shabani
            Mande and other leading industrial professionals. In 2023, it was
            re-launched under the leadership of Eng. Laurent Ndalichako as
            GIACC-Tanzania Executive Chairman.
